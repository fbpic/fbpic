FBPIC documentation
======================================================

FBPIC (Fourier-Bessel Particle-In-Cell) is a `Particle-In-Cell (PIC)
code <http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Particle-in-cell>`_ for
relativistic plasma
physics. It is especially well-suited for physical simulations of **laser-wakefield acceleration** and **plasma-wakefield acceleration**.

The distinctive feature of FBPIC, compared to *most* other PIC codes, is to use
a **spectral cylindrical representation.** This makes the code both **fast**
and **accurate**, for situations with **close-to-cylindrical
symmetry**. For a brief overview of the
algorithm, its advantages and limitations, see the section :doc:`overview`.

In addition, FBPIC implements several **useful features for laser-plasma acceleration**, including:

    * Moving window
    * Calculation of **space-charge fields** at the beginning of the simulation
    * Intrinsic **mitigation of Numerical Cherenkov Radiation** (NCR) from relativistic bunches
    * **Field ionization** module (ADK model)
    * Support for **boosted-frame simulations** (see :doc:`advanced/boosted_frame`)


FBPIC can run on **multi-core CPU** (with multi-threading) or **GPU**. For large
simulations, running the code on GPU can be much faster than on CPU.

.. note::

   Running simulations with **multiple** CPU nodes or **multiple** GPUs
   (using **MPI**) is currently functional, but not yet officially supported.
   Use this feature with caution for now.


Contents of the documentation
-------------------------------------

If you are new to FBPIC, we **strongly recommend** that you read the
section :doc:`overview` first, so as to have a basic understanding of
what the code does.

You can then see the section :doc:`install/installation` and
:doc:`how_to_run`, to get started with using FBPIC. For more
information, the section :doc:`api_reference/api_reference` lists the main objects
that are accessible through FBPIC.
