Installation on Titan (OLCF)
================================================

`Titan <https://www.olcf.ornl.gov/titan/>`__ is a GPU supercomputer at the
`Oakridge Leadership Computing Facility
<https://www.olcf.ornl.gov/>`__ (OLCF).

Each node consists of 1 Nvidia K20 device.

Installing FBPIC
----------------

Installation of Anaconda
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

In order to install FBPIC, you need to first install `Anaconda <https://www.continuum.io/why-anaconda>`__:

-  Download Miniconda:

   ::

       wget http://repo.continuum.io/miniconda/Miniconda-latest-Linux-x86_64.sh -O miniconda.sh

-  Execute the installation script, and use ``/ccs/proj/<project_id>``
   as an install directory, so that the installation is accessible to
   the compute nodes.

   ::

       bash miniconda.sh -b -p /ccs/proj/<project_id>/miniconda2

   where the bracketed text should be replaced by the values for your
   account.

-  Add the following lines at the end of your .bashrc

   ::

       module load python_anaconda
       export PATH=/ccs/proj/<project_id>/miniconda2/bin:$PATH
       export LD_LIBRARY_PATH=$LD_LIBRARY_PATH:/ccs/proj/<project_id>/miniconda2/lib
       export PYTHONPATH=$PYTHONPATH:/ccs/proj/<project_id>/miniconda2/lib/python2.7/site-packages/
       export PYTHONPATH=$PYTHONPATH:/sw/xk6/python_anaconda/2.3.0/sles11.3_gnu4.8.2/lib/python2.7/site-packages/

   where again the bracketed text should be replaced by the values for
   your account. The first line gives access to the ``mpi4py``
   installation of Titan (which is contained in the module
   ``python_anaconda``) while the other lines allow you to use packages
   that you install locally.

Then execute the modified .bashrc file: ``source .bashrc``.

Installation of FBPIC and its dependencies
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

- Install the dependencies by typing

  ::

    conda install numba scipy h5py mkl
    conda install cudatoolkit=8.0 pyculib

-  Clone and install the ``fbpic`` repository using git

  ::

    git clone git://github.com/fbpic/fbpic.git
    cd fbpic
    python setup.py install

Running simulations
------------------------------------------

In order to create a new simulation, create a new directory in
``$MEMBERWORK/`` and copy your input script there:

::

    mkdir $MEMBERWORK/<project_id>/<simulation name>
    cp fbpic_script.py $MEMBERWORK/<project_id>/<simulation name>

Interactive jobs
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

In order to request an interactive job:

::

    qsub -I -A <project_id> -l nodes=1,walltime=00:30:00 -q debug

Once the job has started, switch to your simulation directory

::

    cd $MEMBERWORK/<project_id>/<simulation name>

Then use ``aprun`` to launch the job on a GPU (even for single-node job)

::

    aprun -n 1 -N 1 python <fbpic_script.py>

Batch jobs
~~~~~~~~~~

Create a file ``submission_script`` with contains the following text:

::

    #!/bin/bash
    #PBS -A <project_id>
    #PBS -l walltime=<your walltime>
    #PBS -l nodes=<number of nodes>

    cd  $MEMBERWORK/<project_id>/<simulation name>

    aprun -n <number of nodes> -N 1 python fbpic_script.py

Then submit it with:

::

   qsub submission_script
