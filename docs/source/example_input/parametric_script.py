"""
This script runs two simulations in parallel using MPI,
with each simulation having a different value of a0 as input.
(Each simulation is performed by a different MPI process.)

This makes use of the parameter `use_all_mpi_ranks=False` in
the `Simulation` object, which allows each MPI rank to carry out a
different simulation. Search for the lines tagged with the comment
`Parametric scan` to find the lines that are key for this technique.

This can be useful for instance to run several simulations on one
node that has several GPUs.

Usage

In a terminal, type:
