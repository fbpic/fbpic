        """
        Initializes a communicator object.

        Parameters
        ----------
        Nz, Nr: int
            The number of cells in the global physical domain
            (i.e. without damp cells and guard cells)

        zmin, zmax, rmax: float
            The position of the edges of the global physical domain in z and r
            (i.e. without damp cells and guard cells)

        Nm: int
            The total number of modes

        dt: float
            The timestep of the simulation

        v_comoving: float or None, optional
            If this variable is None, the standard PSATD is used (default).
            Otherwise, the current is assumed to be "comoving",
            i.e. constant with respect to (z - v_comoving * t).
            This can be done in two ways: either by
            - Using a PSATD scheme that takes this hypothesis into account
            - Solving the PSATD scheme in a Galilean frame

        use_galilean: bool, optional
            Determines which one of the two above schemes is used
            When use_galilean is true, the whole grid moves
            with a speed v_comoving

        boundaries: str
            Indicates how to exchange the fields at the left and right
            boundaries of the global simulation box.
            (Either 'periodic' or 'open')

        n_order: int
           The order of the stencil for the z derivatives.
           Use -1 for infinite order, otherwise use a positive, even
           number. In this case, the stencil extends up to approx.
           2*n_order cells on each side. (A finite order stencil
           is required to have a localized field push that allows
           to do simulations in parallel on multiple MPI ranks)

        n_guard: int, optional
            Number of guard cells to use at the left and right of
            a domain, when performing parallel (MPI) computation
            or when using open boundaries. Defaults to None, which
            calculates the required guard cells for n_order
            automatically (approx 2*n_order). If no MPI is used and
            in the case of open boundaries with an infinite order stencil,
            n_guard defaults to 64, if not set otherwise.

        n_damp : int, optional
            Number of damping guard cells at the left and right of a
            simulation box if a moving window is attached. The guard
            region at these areas (left / right of moving window) is
            extended by n_damp in order to smoothly
            damp the fields such that they do not wrap around.
            (Defaults to 64)

        n_inject: int, optional
            Number of injection cells (at the left and right) of a simulation
            box, for a simulation with open boundaries. The damping region
            needs to be additionally extended by n_inject cells at the
            outer edges to have a region with zero fields where new particles
            can be injected. For symmetry reasons those cells are added at
            both sides of the simulation box, although particles are typically
            injected only at the right side of the box.
            (Defaults to None and is set to n_guard/2 automatically)

        exchange_period: int, optional
            Number of iterations before which the particles are exchanged.
            If set to None, the maximum exchange period is calculated
            automatically: Within exchange_period timesteps, the
            particles should never be able to travel more than
            (n_guard/2 - particle_shape order) cells. (Setting exchange_period
            to small values can substantially affect the performance)

        use_all_mpi_ranks: bool, optional
            - if `use_all_mpi_ranks` is True (default):
              All the MPI ranks will contribute to the same simulation,
              using domain-decomposition to share the work.
            - if `use_all_mpi_ranks` is False:
              Each MPI rank will run an independent simulation.
              This can be useful when running parameter scans.

        Depending on whether the field data is initially on the CPU
        or on the GPU, this function will do the appropriate exchange
        with the device.

        The layout of the local domain and a neighboring domain
        can be visualised like this:
                      ---------------------
                      |ng|nc|       |nc|ng|    <- Local domain (rank)

        ---------------------
        |ng|nc|       |nc|ng|                  <- Neighboring domain (rank-1)
        ---------------------
        The area "ng" defines the region of the guard cells with length n_guard
        The area "nc" defines a region within the domain, that contains the
        correct simulation data and has also a length of n_guard cells.
        This region overlaps with the guard cells of the neighboring domain.

        Replacing of fields:

        - Copy the correct part "nc" of the local domain to the guard cells
          of the neighboring domain.
        - [The fields in the guard cells are then damped (separate method)]

        Adding of fields:

        - Copy the guard cell region "ng" and the correct part "nc" and
          add it to the same region (ng + nc) of the neighboring domain.
