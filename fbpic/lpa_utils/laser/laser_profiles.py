        Parameters
        ----------

        a0: float (dimensionless)
            The peak normalized vector potential at the focal plane, defined
            as :math:`a_0` in the above formula.

        waist: float (in meter)
            Laser waist at the focal plane, defined as :math:`w_0` in the
            above formula.

        tau: float (in second)
            The duration of the laser (in the lab frame),
            defined as :math:`\\tau` in the above formula.

        z0: float (in meter)
            The initial position of the centroid of the laser
            (in the lab frame), defined as :math:`z_0` in the above formula.

        zf: float (in meter), optional
            The position of the focal plane (in the lab frame).
            If ``zf`` is not provided, the code assumes that ``zf=z0``, i.e.
            that the laser pulse is at the focal plane initially.

        theta_pol: float (in radian), optional
           The angle of polarization with respect to the x axis.

        lambda0: float (in meter), optional
            The wavelength of the laser (in the lab frame), defined as
            :math:`\\lambda_0` in the above formula.
            Default: 0.8 microns (Ti:Sapph laser).

        cep_phase: float (in radian), optional
            The Carrier Enveloppe Phase (CEP), defined as :math:`\phi_{cep}`
            in the above formula (i.e. the phase of the laser
            oscillation, at the position where the laser enveloppe is maximum)

        phi2_chirp: float (in second^2)
            The amount of temporal chirp, at focus (in the lab frame)
            Namely, a wave packet centered on the frequency
            :math:`(\omega_0 + \delta \omega)` will reach its peak intensity
            at :math:`z(\delta \omega) = z_0 - c \phi^{(2)} \, \delta \omega`.
            Thus, a positive :math:`\phi^{(2)}` corresponds to positive chirp,
            i.e. red part of the spectrum in the front of the pulse and blue
            part of the spectrum in the back.

        propagation_direction: int, optional
            Indicates in which direction the laser propagates.
            This should be either 1 (laser propagates towards positive z)

            The above formula depends on a parameter :math:`m`

            (i.e. the number of required azimuthal modes is ``Nm=m+2``)

            The non-linear plasma response for this profile (e.g.
            wakefield driven by the ponderomotive force) may require
            even more azimuthal modes.

        Parameters
        ----------

        p: int (positive)
            The order of the Laguerre polynomial. (Increasing ``p`` increases
            the number of "rings" in the radial intensity profile of the laser.)

        m: int (positive)
            The azimuthal order of the pulse.

            :math:`\cos[m(\\theta-\\theta_0)]`.)

        a0: float (dimensionless)
            The amplitude of the pulse, defined so that the total
            energy of the pulse is the same as that of a Gaussian pulse
            with the same :math:`a_0`, :math:`w_0` and :math:`\\tau`.
            (i.e. The energy of the pulse is independent of ``p`` and ``m``.)

        waist: float (in meter)
            Laser waist at the focal plane, defined as :math:`w_0` in the
            above formula.

            defined as :math:`\\tau` in the above formula.

        z0: float (in meter)
            The initial position of the centroid of the laser
            (in the lab frame), defined as :math:`z_0` in the above formula.

        zf: float (in meter), optional
            The position of the focal plane (in the lab frame).
            If ``zf`` is not provided, the code assumes that ``zf=z0``, i.e.
            that the laser pulse is at the focal plane initially.

        theta_pol: float (in radian), optional
           The angle of polarization with respect to the x axis.

        lambda0: float (in meter), optional
            The wavelength of the laser (in the lab frame), defined as
            :math:`\\lambda_0` in the above formula.
            Default: 0.8 microns (Ti:Sapph laser).

        cep_phase: float (in radian), optional
            The Carrier Enveloppe Phase (CEP), defined as :math:`\phi_{cep}`
            in the above formula (i.e. the phase of the laser
            oscillation, at the position where the laser enveloppe is maximum)

        theta0: float (in radian), optional
            The azimuthal position of (one of) the maxima of intensity, in the
            transverse plane.
            (In the transverse plane, the field of the pulse varies as
            :math:`\cos[m(\\theta-\\theta_0)]`.)

        propagation_direction: int, optional
            Indicates in which direction the laser propagates.
            This should be either 1 (laser propagates towards positive z)

        .. warning::
            The above formula depends on a parameter :math:`m`
            (see documentation below). In order to be properly resolved by
            the simulation, a Laguerre-Gauss profile with a given :math:`m`
            requires the azimuthal modes from :math:`0` to :math:`|m|+1`.
            (i.e. the number of required azimuthal modes is ``Nm=|m|+2``)

        Parameters
        ----------

        p: int
            The order of the Laguerre polynomial. (Increasing ``p`` increases
            the number of "rings" in the radial intensity profile of the laser.)

        m: int (positive or negative)
            The azimuthal order of the pulse. The laser phase in a given
            transverse plane varies as :math:`m \\theta`.

        a0: float (dimensionless)
            The amplitude of the pulse, defined so that the total
            energy of the pulse is the same as that of a Gaussian pulse
            with the same :math:`a_0`, :math:`w_0` and :math:`\\tau`.
            (i.e. The energy of the pulse is independent of ``p`` and ``m``.)

        waist: float (in meter)
            Laser waist at the focal plane, defined as :math:`w_0` in the
            above formula.

        tau: float (in second)
            The duration of the laser (in the lab frame),
            defined as :math:`\\tau` in the above formula.

        z0: float (in meter)
            The initial position of the centroid of the laser
            (in the lab frame), defined as :math:`z_0` in the above formula.

        zf: float (in meter), optional
            The position of the focal plane (in the lab frame).
            If ``zf`` is not provided, the code assumes that ``zf=z0``, i.e.
            that the laser pulse is at the focal plane initially.

        theta_pol: float (in radian), optional
           The angle of polarization with respect to the x axis.

        lambda0: float (in meter), optional
            The wavelength of the laser (in the lab frame), defined as
            :math:`\\lambda_0` in the above formula.
            Default: 0.8 microns (Ti:Sapph laser).

        cep_phase: float (in radian), optional
            The Carrier Enveloppe Phase (CEP), defined as :math:`\phi_{cep}`
            in the above formula (i.e. the phase of the laser
            oscillation, at the position where the laser enveloppe is maximum)

        propagation_direction: int, optional
            Indicates in which direction the laser propagates.
            This should be either 1 (laser propagates towards positive z)
            or -1 (laser propagates towards negative z).

        When a laser pulse is so short that it contains **only a few laser cycles**,
        the standard Gaussian profile :any:`GaussianLaser` is not well-adapted.
        This is because :any:`GaussianLaser` neglects the fact that different
        frequencies focus in different ways. In particular, when initializing
        a :any:`GaussianLaser` (with a short duration :math:`\\tau`) out of
        focus, the profile at focus will not be the expected one.

        Instead, the :any:`FewCycleLaser` profile overcomes this limitation.
        The electric field for this profile is given by (see
        `Caron & Potvilege, Journal of Modern Optics 46, 1881 (1999)
        <https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1080/09500349908231378>`__):

            \\frac{r^2}{2q(z)}\\right)\\right)^{-(s+1)} \\right]

        where :math:`k_0 = 2\pi/\\lambda_0` is the wavevector,
        :math:`E_0 = m_e c^2 k_0 / q_e` is the field amplitude for :math:`a_0=1`,
        :math:`Z_R = k_0 w_0^2/2` is the Rayleigh length,

            In the case of :math:`\omega_0 \\tau_{FWHM} \gg 1` (i.e. many
            laser cycles within the envelope), the above expression approaches
            that of a standard Gaussian laser pulse, and thus the :any:`FewCycleLaser`
            profile becomes equivalent to the :any:`GaussianLaser` profile
            (with :math:`\\tau_{FWHM} = \\sqrt{2\\log(2)}\\tau`).
