class LaserAntenna( object ):
    """
    Class that implements the emission of a laser by an antenna

    The antenna produces a current on the grid (in a thin slice along z), which
    matches the electric field to be emitted, according to the formula
    j(t) = 2 \epsilon_0 c E_emitted(z0, t)
    (The above formula is valid for an antenna at a fixed z0. When running in
    the boosted frame, the antenna is moving and the proportionality coefficient
    is modified accordingly.)

    This current is produced on the grid by using virtual macroparticles (this
    ensures that the charge conservation is properly satisfied), whose
    positions are stored in the LaserAntenna object. The motion of the virtual
    particles is prescribed, and their charge and currents are deposited
    at each timestep during the PIC loop.

    Note that the antenna is made of a set of matching positive and negative
    macroparticles, which are exactly superimposed when there is no emission,
    and which have opposite excursions when there is some emission.
    (Therefore, only the excursion of the positive particles is stored; the
    excursion of the negative is infered e.g. before depositing their current)

    Since the number of macroparticles is small, both updating their motion
    and depositing their charge/current is always done on the CPU.
    For GPU performance, the charge/current are deposited in a small-size array
    (corresponding to a thin slice in z) which is then transfered to the GPU
    and added into the full-size array of charge/current.
    Note that the antenna always uses linear shape factors (even when the
    rest of the simulation uses cubic shape factors.)
