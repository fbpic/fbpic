    Set up periodic checkpoints of the simulation

    The checkpoints are saved in openPMD format, in the specified

    The E and B fields and particle information of each processor is saved.

    NB: Checkpoints are registered in the list `checkpoints` of the Simulation
    object `sim`, and written at the end of the PIC loop (whereas regular
    diagnostics are written at the beginning of the PIC loop).

    Parameters
    ----------
    sim: a Simulation object
       The simulation that is to be saved in checkpoints

    period: integer
       The number of PIC iteration between each checkpoint.

    """
    Fills the Simulation object `sim` with data saved in a checkpoint.

    More precisely, the following data from `sim` is overwritten:

    - Current time and iteration number of the simulation
    - Position of the boundaries of the simulation box
    - Values of the field arrays
    - Size and values of the particle arrays

    Any other information (e.g. diagnostics of the simulation, presence of a
    moving window, presence of a laser antenna, etc.) need to be set by hand.

    For this reason, a successful restart will often require to modify the
    original input script that produced the checkpoint, rather than to start
    a new input script from scratch.

    NB: This function should always be called *before* the initialization
    of the moving window, since the moving window infers the position of
    particle injection from the existing particle data.

    Parameters
    ----------
    sim: a Simulation object
       The Simulation object into which the checkpoint should be loaded

    iteration: integer, optional
       The iteration number of the checkpoint from which to restart
       If None, the latest checkpoint available will be used.

    checkpoint_dir: string, optional
        The path to the directory that contains the checkpoints to be loaded.

        same path for all ranks.)
